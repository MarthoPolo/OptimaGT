All of the core muscles are essential in supporting and minimizing strain on the spine.See Pulled Back Muscle and Lower Back StrainHowever, unlike muscles in the arms and legs, core muscles do not get much use during typical daily activities. To build strength in core abdominal and back muscles requires exercises that focus specifically in these muscle groups.See Strengthening Exercise Program for Low Back Pain ReliefBack-strengthening exercises can result in:In most cases, strengthening exercises are recommended 2 or 3 times a week, and as part of an overall program of stretching and aerobic exercise.Two of the most commonly used back strengthening programs are the McKenzie Method and dynamic stabilization, both of which are typically learned by working with a physical therapist. The kind of program prescribed typically depends on the patient’s condition and needs, as well as the doctor’s preference and familiarity with an exercise program.See Manual Physical Therapy for Pain ReliefWhen appropriate, exercises from both the McKenzie Method and dynamic stabilization may be combined.McKenzie's exercises relieve lower back pain by promoting spinal extension and reducing disc pressure.McKenzie Method exercises are designed to alleviate back pain caused by conditions affecting a spinal disc, such as degenerative disc disease or a herniated disc. These exercises are usually less effective for pain caused by osteoarthritis in the facet joints and/or spinal stenosis.See What is the McKenzie Method for Back Pain and Neck Pain?One of the primary goals of the McKenzie Method is “centralizing” pain, through:See The McKenzie Method for Neck and Back ProblemsLeg raise exercise helps strengthen the lower back and core muscles.The goal of dynamic stabilization exercises is to find and maintain the neutral spine—a natural posture that accommodates the spine’s curvature and minimizes stress. Maintaining the neutral spine in a healthy posture is achieved through muscle conditioning and a learned awareness of joint positions (called proprioception).See Lumbar Spine Stabilization ExercisesDynamic stabilization includes a range of exercises that can accommodate nearly anyone. For more severe pain, it is usually recommended to start with an exercise such as leg raises that gently and gradually strengthen the low back and core muscles. More rigorous exercises may include pelvic tilts or exercises using an exercise ball.Many options are available that can effectively strengthen the spine and provide relief, and finding one that works and can be maintained is often driven by personal preference, local instructors available, and a process of trial and error in finding pain relief.Common forms of strengthening exercise can include:These strengthening exercises and others may be learned with help from a physical therapist, chiropractor, physiatrist, athletic trainers and more. It is important to work with a well-qualified professional, as learning the correct form for exercise is essential for building strength and stability without pain or injury.See How a Physical Therapist Can Help with ExerciseConsulting with a doctor or other qualified health professional is recommended before adding to an exercise routine, to ensure any new exercise won’t compromise healthy or healing spinal structures.See Specialists Who Treat Back Pain
