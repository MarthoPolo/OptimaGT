There's never a bad time to start.The best type of exercise for beginners is the one you'll actually do. Without sounding flippant, the likelihood of keeping up a type of fitness you hate is minimal. But if you find a form of exercise you love – be it .css-193b727{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;text-decoration-color:#f7623b;text-underline-offset:0.25rem;color:inherit;-webkit-transition:background 0.4s;transition:background 0.4s;word-break:break-word;background:linear-gradient(#ffffff, #ffffff 50%, #feebe7 50%, #feebe7);-webkit-background-size:100% 200%;background-size:100% 200%;}.css-193b727:hover{color:#000000;text-decoration-color:border-link-body-hover;-webkit-background-position:100% 100%;background-position:100% 100%;}strength training, Pilates, cardio home workouts, weightlifting (or working towards a specific strength goal with exercises for a bigger butt, for example) – it'll feel easier to carve out some time for it in your week. And, to set the record straight; it doesn’t matter whether you’ve never exercised before, are a newbie to home workouts, were a keen gym workout aficionado before the year of never-ending lockdowns or you're starting fitness at 50, everyone needs a little help trying something new. In fact, we all have those days when a workout feels like starting from scratch. The secret is to not let those feelings stop you from getting started. To quote Hillary Duff's seminal movie, A Cinderella Story: 'Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.' Amen, Hilz. Amen.So, whether you’re searches for exercise for beginners is because that’s what you are, a genuine beginner, or if you’re wanting to know how to start exercising after some time away, we’ve pulled together the info you need to smash your goals. The million-dollar question but, ultimately, the choice is yours. If you’re new to exercise, one of your main priorities should be finding an activity that makes you feel like you could conquer the world.Having a go-to repertoire of workouts that make you feel really good, is a key player in retaining motivation and preventing workout boredom, but it can be difficult to know where to begin.The good news? When it comes to health and for beginners, you do not need to be working out every day. In fact, if you are, you could be doing yourself more harm than good.‘Every time you strength train, you cause micro tears in the muscle,’ says Astrid Swan, NASM-certified master trainer at Barry’s Bootcamp in West Hollywood, CA. ‘The muscle needs time to heal, and as it heals, it grows and you see results.’ Which means?By following the same exercise programme or working out the same part of the body day in, day out, you won’t get more fit or pocket extra gains. Instead, you’ll be likely to plateau, lose workout motivation or cause an overuse injury.‘I recommend to my clients [invariably not beginners] to work out hard five times a week, taking a day between for a lighter workout and a full day of rest,’ says Swan. ‘My advice is to work out hard and then let the body recover. You will see results faster and be happier with your efforts.’Disclaimer: If you’re just starting exercising, this is something to work towards. Don't let it discourage you. It’s all about the journey, remember, not the destination.The NHS recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as cycling or brisk walking, every week and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).Or, a mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity every week, plus strength exercises.The general rule of thumb is that one minute of vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as two minutes of moderate activity, says the NHS. So bear this in mind when planning your week to ensure you're not doing too much.For beginners, three to four sessions per week are more than enough to start feeling fitter and ingraining your new exercise habit as a fundamental part of your lifestyle. How to begin working out? The great thing is you don't need anything at all — an exercise mat might help to avoid slipping and to support the joints, but it's not 100% necessary. Another upside of working out at home is you're already where you need to be and there's no worry about other people watching (although, they rarely are anyway), making it ideal for those new to the game. A good way to kick off your exercise routine is by getting involved with a plan. Whether that's a HIIT plan, strength training plan or something more low-impact (e.g. a walking plan), having a schedule to follow makes it much easier to stay the course – especially when you don't necessarily feel like getting it done.Or there are home workout apps to help you get started with exercise for beginners at home, as well as a plethora of YouTube videos designed especially for at-home beginner workouts.Don't worry, we've found the ones that are worth your sweat:But, and this is important, warming up is crucial to keep you injury-free. If you want to avoid shin splints, hip pain, painful knees and other potential injuries then make time for a quick warm-up at the top of your workouts.Try out these dynamic stretches that mimic common workout moves or 3 minute warm-up for runners.Consistency = everything. If you can commit to working out ten minutes a day then everyone's happy. It's about making the most of those ten minutes and working up to hit the NHS' weekly exercise recommendation of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity a week.The NHS' 'Active 10' programme helps to get you walking for 10 minutes a day – the brisk activity has been shown to deliver a number of benefits, from reduced lower back pain to high blood pressure decreases and a clearer mind in the short term.If you're wanting to know about the best or easiest exercise for beginners to lose weight at home or in the gym, then that's a slightly different story. Weight loss comes down to a few things – proper nutrition, adequate sleep, enough movement and good stress management. Learn exactly how to lose weight well (and for good) and you'll be set for success.It's never too late to start exercising — and, if there was (which there isn't), it definitely wouldn't be 50.For whatever reason, working out hasn't been high up your list of priorities. Until now... And, why now? It helps if you have a clear motivation; staving off injury, stronger bones, more energy, simply feeling happier and healthier.‘Strength training helps with bone density, which decreases as you get older, so it’s really important for reducing the risk of osteoporosis,’ explains Anna Parker, PT and founder of AP FITNESS. ‘It doesn’t have to mean lifting heavy hand weights, but it can be a good option if you're not confident going for a run or doing cardio. I always recommend starting light, maybe with resistance bands and then small dumbbells, then working your way up.’Try to keep your new exercising habit regular, ideally at least half an hour of moderate to vigorous two times a week for noticeable health benefits, allowing 48 hours in between working out the same muscle groups to allow your body to recover. And try a variety of exercises to discover what you like and keep things interesting, but make sure you get a combination of strength to keep atrophy (loss of muscle mass) at bay, balance to reduce risk of injury and stretching to improve flexibility.The main thing is to enjoy yourself, so you could ask a friend to get involved and start off with bodyweight exercises in your living room while catching up. If you're looking for easy exercises for beginners, bodyweight is where to start. These are great for getting to grips with movements before adding extra challenge with weights.

Stretch. It. Out. Try lead consultant osteopath at The Mayfair Clinic Michael Fatica's five favourite stretches post-exercise for beginners:       Stretch the calves by placing one foot in front of the other and bend the front knee. Keeping both heels on the floor, lean forwards with the body until you feel a stretch in the back leg. You can place your hands on a chair in front of you for support.        Stand with one heel off a step - perhaps the last step at the foot of your staircase - and hold for approximately two minutes on each leg.       Kneel on the floor in a lunge position and gradually bend the front knee to move your pelvis towards the floor, stretching the front of your hip region. As before, hold each side for approximately two minutes.Sit on a chair and put your right foot on your left knee, then pull your right knee towards your chest. Try to keep your low back flat to protect it. Repeat for the left leg. Hold the stretch for approximately two minutes on each side.  Er no. But, the more into your workouts you get – which believe us, won’t take long – you may want to consider switching up your nutrition to better fuel your training. One way to do this is to track your macros. Eating according to your macros, also known as 'counting your macros' is basically a way of balancing your protein, carb and fat intake to ensure your body can best build and repair muscle, maintain optimal hormone production and simply stay active. And yes, you can still eat chips on it. Result. If counting macros is a bit much for you, aim to incorporate some form of protein into every meal. It'll keep you fuller for longer and help with muscle building and repair. The NHS suggests UK adults should aim for 50g of protein per day but if you're working out vigorously for more than 150 minutes per week, it could be a good idea to up this to 1.2-1.5g per kg of bodyweight. E.g. if you weigh 70kg, you'd aim to consume anywhere between 70 and 105g of protein a day. £29.95£29.95£18.99 .css-1jdv4nh{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;text-decoration-color:#f7623b;text-underline-offset:0.25rem;color:#000;-webkit-transition:all 0.3s ease-in-out;transition:all 0.3s ease-in-out;word-break:break-word;display:inline-block;background:linear-gradient(#ffffff, #ffffff 50%, #feebe7 50%, #feebe7);-webkit-background-size:100% 200%;background-size:100% 200%;font-family:NationalBold,NationalBold-fallback,NationalBold-robotoFallback,NationalBold-localFallback,Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;text-transform:uppercase;width:auto;padding:0.5rem 0.7rem;background-color:#f7623b;border-radius:0.3125rem;font-size:0.875rem;line-height:1;border:thin solid #f7623b;letter-spacing:0.045rem;}.css-1jdv4nh:hover{color:#000;text-decoration-color:border-link-body-hover;-webkit-background-position:100% 100%;background-position:100% 100%;background-color:#ffffff;border:thin solid #f7623b;}.css-1jdv4nh:focus-visible{outline-color:body-cta-btn-link-focus;}SHOP NOW£29.99To hit your protein requirement, protein shakes can be a great option to be enjoyed as a moderate addition to an already healthy diet – not as a substitute for actual food.

Especially if you have serious goals in the gains department.The last thing to say, before we let you go and get sweaty with all your exercise for beginner nous, is that you can never fail your fitness journey Whether you've never worked out before, had a week off or are coming back after a considerably longer time away, starting a new exercise routine is to be applauded. Do what you can, when you can, cementing sustainable habits, and you'll stay on track. Once you settle into a groove, exercise can feel like magic, especially when the endorphins kick in.
