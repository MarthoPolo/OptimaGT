Use Current LocationUse Map SelectorEating a heart-healthy diet benefits both your body and your brain. In general, this is a diet that focuses on foods that are less processed and lower in fat, along with more vegetables and leaner meats and proteins. These diets can help reduce heart disease and may also be able to reduce the risk of cognitive decline.

Be aware that while companies or individuals may promote "medical foods" or dietary supplements, there is no single food, beverage, ingredient, vitamin or supplement (PDF) that has been proven to prevent or cure Alzheimer's or any other dementia. 

The Alzheimer's Association is launching a two-year clinical trial researching lifestyle intervention on protecting brain health and potentially reducing the risk of dementia. Our U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) trial will test if combining physical activity, healthy nutrition, social and intellectual challenge and improved self-management of medical conditions can protect cognitive function in older adults who are at increased risk for cognitive decline. Trial recruitment begins this year.
