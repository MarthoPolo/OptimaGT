Once you have recovered sufficiently from a traumatic injury and are well enough to leave the acute hospital, staff will discuss the next steps in your recovery with you. You may need help to improve your mobility or function. Rehabilitation services can provide help and care to assist with your physical state after severe trauma. Rehabilitation can begin as soon as you are stable while you are in hospital and the types of rehabilitation will depend on your individual needs. 
Rehabilitation services aim to increase your independence and physical function after injury and to return you to as much of your previous ability as possible. Where it is not possible for you to return to doing things as you used to, the rehabilitation process will help you explore new ways of doing things.

Costs will vary depending on your needs and whether you are a public patient (with or without a Medicare card), a private patient, or eligible for funding from the TAC, WorkSafe Victoria or Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
