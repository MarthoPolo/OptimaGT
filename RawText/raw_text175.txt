Back Pain & Posture AdviceBy: Leon Turetsky (NASM-CPT, NASM-CES), Last Updated: November 1, 2023, Reviewed By: Dr. David Oliver, DC If you suffer from lower back pain, you’re not alone – nearly 80% of adults experience low-back pain at some point in their lives.[1]Some of the most common causes for low back pain include: pulling a muscle in the low back, overuse, poor posture, improper lifting technique and excessive sitting. It’s been shown in research that if you’re looking to reduce your low back pain you’ll need to strengthen your low (lumbar) back muscles and your core muscles.[2][3]It’s important that you focus on strengthening both the smaller, deep (Local) muscles, as well as the outer (global) muscles [4]… All these muscles work together to help stabilize your spine and pelvis – which in turn will reduce low back pain, stabilize your spine, and prevent injuries.Related Article: 7 Stretches for Lower back painSome of the muscles that are essential to strengthen include:
