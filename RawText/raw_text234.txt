Your Nutrition and Food Safety ResourceShare With:You’ve likely witnessed someone turning over a packaged food to look at the serving size on the Nutrition Facts label with surprise. They’ve probably also said something along the lines of, “is this really how much I’m supposed to eat?” – or maybe you’ve experienced this yourself.But do Americans really know what the purpose of the serving size on the Nutrition Facts Label is, and how it differs from the concept of portion size? How exactly do Americans use serving and portion size, and what are their reasons for wanting to manage how much food they eat? This survey aimed to explore Americans’ understanding of both serving and portion size.Of those who claimed knowledge of serving size, almost half (48%) picked the correct definition for the term, which is the standardized amount of a food or beverage that people typically consume in one sitting. Slightly fewer (46%) thought it was defined by the company that created the product. Of those who claimed knowledge of portion size, the most selected definition for the term was actually the definition for serving size. However, this was closely followed by the correct definition – the amount one chooses to eat in one sitting (45%).However, one in 6 survey respondents reported that they don’t pay attention to portion sizes, with people over the age of 45 and those earning less than $40,000 per year being more likely to say this, compared to their counterparts. When asked about why they don’t, nearly three-quarters (71%) said they don’t want to be too restrictive on how much they eat or drink. One-third (33%) said it is more important not to waste food than to have the right portion size.MethodologySurvey results were derived from online interviews of 1,000 adults conducted from November 4 to November 9, 2021, by Lincoln Park Strategies. They were weighted to ensure proportional representation of the population, with a margin of error of ±3.1 points at the 95% confidence level.
